This catalogue was prepared by Stephen Freeth, contract archivist, in the period December 2008 to Autumn 2010. In so doing, he continued the work of an earlier contract archivist, Anna Greening, whose detailed work on the Bagrow papers in 2005-6 had been cut short by illness. The catalogue sequence is as follows:. MSS 1-11 Bagrow papers; MSS 12-24 Skelton papers (from 1949 onwards); MSS 25-33 Roukema papers; MSS 34-46 Koeman papers; MSS 47-67 Eila Campbell editorial papers (from 1947 onwards); MSS 68-9 Eila Campbell papers about the International Directories of Current Research in the History of Cartography; MSS 70-2 Eila Campbell papers about the International Conferences on the History of Cartography [to 1991]; MSS 73-85 Catherine Delano Smith papers; MSS 86-7 Margary papers; MSS 88-106 Tony Campbell papers; MSS 107-112 Formal records of Imago Mundi Limited; MS 113 Prospectuses and publicity material; MS 114-5 Papers assembled during cataloguing; . Later records of international conferences organised under the auspices of Imago Mundi, from 1997, may be found within the papers of Tony Campbell (MS 102). See also MS 83. Users should note that the officers of Imago Mundi were often writing to each other, so that their respective papers contain many instances of opposite ends of the same correspondence.",Archives and Manuscripts,,,,,,,,,"The archives of Imago Mundi up to c1970 were deposited in the British Library Map Room by Eila Campbell in 1978. At that stage they comprised the papers of Bagrow, Skelton, Roukema and Koeman. Other material has been added since, in particular papers of Eila Campbell herself, of her successor Catherine Delano Smith, and of Harry Margary (Treasurer 1971-83; Secretary 1973-83) and of Tony Campbell (no relation of Eila Campbell; Chairman since 1993; Secretary/Treasurer since 1995). Unfortunately by the time of cataloguing many papers had fallen into confusion, for various reasons. For a start, each new editor, especially after the sudden deaths of Bagrow, Roukema and Skelton, needed to use those papers which related to unfinished business. Secondly, the various editors were voluntary, part-time, and often working from home. This was not conducive to careful filing. Thirdly, each time the papers of a former editor, usually recently deceased, were passed on, there was potential for jumbling and accidental loss. Odd items are now missing throughout the archives. In Skelton's case, there was a further complication. Although his family donated his Imago Mundi papers to Imago Mundi Limited soon after his death, it sold his library and many of his other papers in 1971 to the Memorial University of Newfoundland. A few items now in Newfoundland appear to be Imago Mundi papers, either of Skelton himself or of Bagrow. Further confusion has arisen from partial attempts at sorting the archives. Firstly, Skelton's younger daughter, Mrs Alexa Barrow, started in 1970-1 to sort her father's Imago Mundi papers into subject files, such as 'Editing', or 'Management'. This project was abandoned at an early stage. Secondly, an attempt was made at some date to merge into one series in date order all the papers of the late 1940s and 1950s about the revival of the journal after the war, whether those of Bagrow, as Editor in Sweden, or of Skelton and Eila Campbell as English 'Corresponding Editors' in London. This approach was no doubt intended to offer the source materials for this key period all together. However it was only carried out piecemeal. It also destroyed the papers' original order, and made it very hard to see what role each individual was playing. All these attempts to sort the archives have been rejected in the present catalogue. Instead the papers of each editor have been carefully separated, and returned as far as possible to their original order. Further details can be found in the various introductory notes. The overall pattern of the archives is surprisingly complete. There is however little for the six Supplements to Imago Mundi, being a series of monographs and facsimiles of rare maps, published between 1958 and 1974. In addition, one complete file of Roukema's and another of Koeman's are now in the Dutch National Archives, as part of Koeman's academic papers. These are represented in the Imago Mundi archives by microfilm copies.",,,"Summary History of Imago Mundi. The journal Imago Mundi was founded by an emigr√© Russian, Leo Bagrow, in 1935. The first issue was published in Germany, in German, in that year, but thereafter articles have normally been published in English, and occasionally French. Trilingual abstracts of each article (English, French and German) were introduced from volume 47 (1995). Apart from the war years, issues have generally appeared at the rate of one volume per year, though in recent years each volume has been issued in two parts. Volumes were numbered in Roman numerals until volume XXVI (1972), and in Arabic numerals from volume 27 (1975). Imago Mundi is a journal of the history of cartography. It is also intended as a journal of record. In addition to learned articles, long and short, it has always tried to include a chronicle of recent events, news from map libraries around the world, book reviews, and a bibliography of new work. Bagrow, the founder and first Editor, an energetic and determined individual, ran Imago Mundi as something of a private fief until his death on 9 August 1957. He commissioned the articles from authors, and secured the funding. After his death, Imago Mundi continued under an international Management Committee, and in 1961 turned into a private non-profitmaking limited company with charitable status. Funding remained a problem however, and from volume 27 (1975) until volume 45 (1993), Imago Mundi was the annual publication of a largely mythical 'International Society for the History of Cartography', and issued free to the 'membership' of regular subscribers. The reference to the 'Society' was dropped from the title page from 1994 (volume 46) onwards. Even Bagrow could not do everything himself, and volume IV (1947) of Imago Mundi attracted criticism of its poor English and proof-reading. He therefore secured the help of two English 'Corresponding Editors', Eila Campbell, of Birkbeck College, London University (from 1947) and, later, RA ('Peter') Skelton of the British Museum Map Room (from 1949). After Bagrow's death Skelton worked as 'Consultant Editor', with a retired Dutch merchant navy captain, Edzer Roukema, as 'Secretary/Editor', to keep Imago Mundi alive. Roukema died in April 1960, and Skelton then became 'Editor-in-Chief' (sometimes 'General Editor'; the precise titles vary), with Dr Ir Cor Koeman of the University of Utrecht as 'Executive Editor'. After Skelton's untimely death in 1970, and Koeman's resignation, Eila Campbell of Birkbeck College took over as Editor in 1972-3. After a long period of stability, she was succeeded in 1993-4 by Catherine Delano Smith, the present Editor. Details of the development of Imago Mundi can be found in various places in the published issues, in particular the editorials or forewords to volumes II (1937), IV (1947), XIII (1956), XVI (1962) and 50 (1998); in RA Skelton's obituary of Bagrow, volume XIV (1959), pages 4-12; and in Skelton's 'Historical Notes on Imago Mundi', XXI (1967), pages 109-10. JB Harley's 'Imago Mundi. The First Fifty Years and the Next Ten', Cartographica 23:3 (1986), pages 1-15, is also very useful.",,,,,,,,,Unrestricted,"Access for Research and Publication.

Leo (Lev Semyonovitch) Bagrow (1881-1957), independent scholar of the history of cartography, was born in Russia. After service before and during the First World War in the Russian Imperial Navy, mainly as a hydrographer, he emigrated soon after the Revolution to Berlin, remaining there until evacuated by a Swedish aircraft in 1945. Thereafter he lived in Stockholm. In 1952 he became a naturalised Swedish citizen. He died on 9 August 1957. Obituaries can be found in Nature, vol 180, page 684, 5 Oct 1957, and Imago Mundi XIV (1959), pages 4-12 (both by Skelton; the latter includes a bibliography); and elsewhere. (See MS 15/1 and 3.) JB Harley's essay, 'Imago Mundi. The First Fifty Years and the Next Ten', Cartographica, vol 23, no 3 (1986), pages 1-15, includes an appreciation of Bagrow. Work for Imago Mundi. Bagrow founded Imago Mundi in Berlin in 1935, and three issues had appeared by the outbreak of the Second World War. The war years suspended publication, as well as destroying almost all Bagrow's personal papers up to that date, but thereafter with great determination he resurrected Imago Mundi. Ten issues (volumes IV to XIII, dated 1956) had appeared by the time of his unexpected death in 1957. Funding came from the Swedish Humanistiska Fonden. Problems with English and proof-reading had forced him from 1947 to seek the assistance of Eila Campbell, and from 1949 that of Peter Skelton also, as English 'Corresponding Editors'. Two weeks before his death, Bagrow had delivered the scripts for volume XIV to the printers/publishers, Mouton & Co, in The Hague. These were put through the press by his successors, Roukema and Skelton (see their papers). Bagrow's Imago Mundi papers. Bagrow's papers start in 1946. All earlier papers except a few fragments were destroyed during the Second World War. They contain many items in languages other than English. Bagrow's own first language was Russian, and as a general rule his wide range of international correspondents communicated with him in their own language. Occasionally Bagrow would have in-letters in other languages translated into Russian for his convenience. His secretary would also sometimes type out handwritten letters from English contacts, still in English, to make them easier for him to read. The material in foreign languages has been sorted as far as possible in the time available, but there may be errors. There are now several gaps in his papers. First, Bagrow almost always drafted his own letters in Russian, in pen and ink, on small pieces of scrap paper, spare proofs and the like, and then had them translated and typed into English, French or German, as appropriate for the recipient. (He could be devious in his choice of language. For example, during a dispute with the German-speaking Franz Babinger, he wrote to him in English, 'because my German is insufficient'. However his true purpose was almost certainly tactical; his German was far better than his English.) Many files contain all or almost all of these handwritten drafts in Russian; others hardly any. Some drafts are therefore missing, though Bagrow did have a tendency to use one piece of scrap paper for several drafts to different people on different topics, so that drafts can be found in unlikely places. The carbon copies of his letters as translated and sent are also incomplete. Nor are there many authors' typescripts, or printer's proofs. This is because Skelton had told Mrs Bagrow in a letter of 11 June 1959 that these were not required. In addition, some Russian letters appear to have been destroyed (see MS 27). Finally, there are few papers of a financial nature (the subsidy received from Sweden's Humanistiska Fonden is referred to only indirectly), or for Anecdota Cartographica, the series of facsimiles of early maps published by Bagrow from 1935 onwards. Bagrow's papers have moved many times since his death. Their first move was in December 1959, when his former secretary, Mrs Busch, sent them from Stockholm to Roukema in the Netherlands. (See Skelton's correspondence with Mrs Busch, MS 14.). Some Bagrow papers only arrived in the Netherlands after Roukema's own death in April 1960. These were returned 'undelivered' to Stockholm, and collected later in 1960 by Skelton. He also received the main part of Bagrow's papers, as well as Roukema's own papers, from Roukema's widow soon after his death. In 1962 Skelton forwarded Bagrow's and Roukema's papers to Koeman, although he appears to have retained a few, now in Newfoundland. (See the introductory note to Skelton's papers.). Koeman's papers, which now included those of Bagrow and Roukema, were collected from Utrecht by Peter Clark for Eila Campbell in the spring of 1976, though two Bagrow items (MSS 8 and 9) were omitted in error. The Bagrow, Roukema and Koeman papers, together with Skelton's own Imago Mundi papers, were then deposited by Eila Campbell in the British Library Map Room in 1978. In 2005-6 Anna Greening substantially rearranged Bagrow's papers into their original order, so far as it is possible to recreate it. Stephen Freeth in 2008-10 merely continued this work. It included dismantling an attempt, made probably in the 1970s or 1980s, to merge into one single sequence all the papers of the late 1940s and 1950s of Bagrow, Skelton and Eila Campbell.",,,,,,,,,Unrestricted,,Not Public Record(s)
